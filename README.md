## Overview

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution remains a critical global issue, resulting in severe health implications and environmental degradation. Specifically, the urban setting of Metro Manila, characterized by heavy traffic congestion and industrial activities, has amplified air pollution concerns, leading to heightened levels of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). In response to this, the project proposes a comprehensive smart air pollution monitoring system integrated with a smog prediction model, incorporating IoT-based sensors and machine learning techniques.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust system that can monitor air quality in real-time and predict smog occurrences. By doing so, the project aims to assist local authorities in implementing effective air quality management strategies, informing the public about the current air quality conditions, and ultimately promoting public health and environmental sustainability in Metro Manila.

## Background

The project is founded upon the extensive research on the adverse impacts of air pollution, particularly in densely populated urban environments. Urbanization and industrialization have significantly contributed to the rise in pollutants, causing severe health issues and the formation of smog. Furthermore, the project recognizes the correlation between air pollution and climate change, emphasizing the necessity for immediate and proactive measures to mitigate these issues.

## Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of air quality and localized pollution levels.
- Integration of IoT-based sensors for precise data collection.
- Implementation of a machine learning model for accurate smog prediction.
- Provision of data feedback to traffic authorities for traffic management.
- Creation of awareness among the general public regarding air quality conditions.

## Purpose

This project serves as a response to the urgent need for effective air quality management systems and predictive models, aiming to address the critical challenges posed by air pollution and smog in densely populated urban environments such as Metro Manila.
