When deciding whether to create new HTML pages or add content to an existing HTML file for different sections of your website, consider the following factors:

Website Structure and Size:

If your website is relatively small and the sections are not content-heavy, keeping them in a single HTML file can be simpler and more manageable.
For larger websites with extensive content in each section, creating separate HTML files for each section can make the site more organized and improve load times.
User Experience:

Multiple pages can be beneficial if each section has a lot of content, as this prevents overwhelming users with too much information on a single page.
Single-page applications (where content loads dynamically) often provide a smoother user experience but may require more complex development, typically involving JavaScript.
SEO Considerations:

Multiple pages can be better for SEO as they allow for more targeted page titles, meta descriptions, and keywords. This can improve the search visibility for different topics or services.
Single-page websites can struggle with SEO due to limited opportunities for optimization and longer load times if the page is content-heavy.
Loading Time:

Multiple pages can reduce initial load time as each page will be smaller than a single large page.
With a single-page design, you need to be cautious about load times, especially if there are many images or heavy content.
Maintenance and Scalability:

Separate HTML files can make the site easier to maintain and scale, especially if different sections are expected to expand or frequently update.
A single HTML file can be easier to maintain for a small website with static content.
Technical Complexity:

Creating separate HTML pages is straightforward and doesnâ€™t usually require extensive front-end programming skills.
Implementing a single-page application with dynamic content loading typically involves JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.
Based on these considerations, if each section of your website is distinct and contains substantial content, or if you anticipate expanding them in the future, it's generally better to create separate HTML pages. This approach not only enhances user experience with faster loading times and more focused content but also improves SEO.

If you decide to create separate pages, you will need to set up navigation links that point to these new pages instead of anchoring to sections within a single page. Each page would then have its own URL, which is beneficial for sharing and bookmarking specific content.
