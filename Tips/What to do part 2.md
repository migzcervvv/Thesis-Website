1. Generating Mock Data:
a. Understand the Data Format:
First, you need to comprehend what kind of data your sensors will send. For instance, if you're using the MQ-135 sensor, it might send values indicating levels of various pollutants like CO2, NOx, and others.

b. Generating the Mock Data:
Here's a simple Python script to generate random air quality readings:

python
Copy code
import random

def generate_mock_data():
    return {
        "CO2": random.randint(300, 500),  # CO2 levels in ppm
        "NOx": random.randint(0, 50),     # NOx levels in ppb
        # ... add more pollutants as required
        "timestamp": "2023-11-03 12:45:22"  # just an example timestamp
    }
You can use this function to simulate the data sent by your sensors.

2. AI Model Development:
a. Data Gathering:

You can find public air quality datasets from platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or governmental environmental websites.

b. Model Development using Scikit-learn:

Preprocessing:
Load the dataset.
Handle any missing values.
Normalize the data if necessary.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# Assuming 'CO2' is what you're predicting and 'NOx', 'temp', etc., are your features
X = data[['NOx', 'temp', ...]]
y = data['CO2']

# Splitting the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Normalize data
scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
X_train = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
Training:
Using a simple linear regression model as a start:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
Save Model:
Save your trained model so you can load it into your Flask app:

python
Copy code
import joblib

joblib.dump(model, 'air_quality_model.pkl')
c. Integration with Flask:

Load the Model:
In your Flask app:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)

model = joblib.load('air_quality_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get data from request and preprocess it
    data = request.json
    processed_data = preprocess_data(data)  # define this function based on your needs
    
    prediction = model.predict(processed_data)
    
    return jsonify({"prediction": prediction.tolist()})
API Endpoints:
Create an endpoint where you can send the current sensor readings and receive back a prediction. Using Flask, you can achieve this with routes. The above '/predict' route is an example.

Connect Frontend to Backend:
Using JavaScript, you can make asynchronous requests to your Flask backend and get the prediction. You'd use fetch or libraries like Axios to achieve this.

javascript
Copy code
fetch('/predict', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ /* your sensor data here */ })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    // Display data.prediction in your frontend
});
Follow the above steps, and remember that while the given code samples are simplified to provide direction, you might need to modify and expand upon them based on your project's specifics and requirements.
